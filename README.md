## Capabilities

Able to automatically handle varied pricing per client, defaults provided for new values, features for reducing required work like instead of retyping standard entries like company names, dropdowns are available. Controls for various things around the file like workbook controls, invoice controls, and more are featured as well.

Workbooks and invoices have lots of time-saving features implemented. For example, when using the workbook, entering just a few pieces of information like company name and part number, automatically pulls the price for the item. Making new invoices is much faster now as well. Totals and entries are filled in and calculated automatically thanks to VBA scripts and cell management. Very little work has to be done to create invoices now.
